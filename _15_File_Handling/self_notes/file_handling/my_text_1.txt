hi, my text file is ready 
hello, this is python txt fileyou can write in this file  This is by far the best answer here and deserves to be on top. One 
                could even write '.'*n to make it more clear. No joining, no zipping, no loops, no list comprehension; 
                just find the next two characters next to each other, which is exactly how a human brain thinks about 
                it. If Monty Python were still alive, he'd love this method! –
