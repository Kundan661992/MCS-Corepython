seek and tell -----
To know the position of pointer, use tell() method.
n = f.tell()
n - represents the byte position
f - represents file object

To move file pointer from one point to another, use seek() method.it makes two arguments
f.seek(offset, from where)
offset - represents how many bytes to move
from where- represents 0, 1, 2 0-beginning
f.seek(10, 0)
This will move pointer to 11th byte 10+1  from beginning

f.seek(-10, 2)
This will move the pointer to 9th byte (-10+1) from ending
2 represents ending of file
-10 represents moving back in the file
