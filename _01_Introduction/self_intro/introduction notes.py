Python--Introduction
------------------------
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development
mathematics,
system scripting.

The Python interpreter is a bytecode interpreter: its input is instruction sets called bytecode.
When you write Python, the lexer, parser, and compiler generate code objects for the interpreter to operate on.

Python allows the programmer to focus on solving problems, rather than focusing on syntax.
Its relative size and simplified syntax give it an edge over languages like Java and C++, yet the abundance of libraries
gives it the power needed to accomplish great things."""

Python Features and advantages
------------------------------
1. Easy to Read, Learn and Write
Python is a high-level programming language that has English-like syntax. 
     This makes it easier to read and understand the code. 
Python is really easy to pick up and learn, that is why a lot of people recommend Python to beginners. 
You need less lines of code to perform the same task as compared to other major languages like C/C++ and Java.

2. Improved Productivity
Python is a very productive language. Due to the simplicity of Python, developers can focus on solving the problem. 
They don’t need to spend too much time in understanding the syntax or behavior of the programming language. 
You write less code and get more things done.

3. Interpreted Language
Python is an interpreted language which means that Python directly executes the code line by line. 
In case of any error, it stops further execution and reports back the error which has occurred. 
Python shows only one error even if the program has multiple errors. 
This makes debugging easier.

4. Dynamically Typed
Python does’t know the type of variable until we run the code. It automatically assigns the data type during execution. 
The programmer does’t need to worry about declaring variables and their data types.

5. Portability
In many languages like C/C++, you need to change your code to run the program on different platforms. 
That is not the same with Python. You only write once and run it anywhere.
