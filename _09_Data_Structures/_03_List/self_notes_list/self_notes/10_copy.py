difference between shallow and deep copying:

A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects 
found in the original. In essence, a shallow copy is only one level deep. The copying process does not recurse and 
therefore wonâ€™t create copies of the child objects themselves.

A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing a new collection object and then 
recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. Copying an object this way walks 
the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of the original object and all of its children.
