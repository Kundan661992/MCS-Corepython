What's the difference between an IDE and an editor?
The term "IDE" comes from Integrated Development Environment.
It is intended as a set of tools that all work together: text editor, compiler, build or make integration,
debugging,etc.
Virtually all IDEs are tied specifically to a language or framework or tightly collected set of languages or
frameworks.

An editor is simply that, a tool that is designed to edit text.
Typically they are optimized for programming languages though many programmer's text editors are branching out
and adding features for non-programming text.
The key here is that text editors are designed to work with whatever language or framework you choose.
Code editors are text editors with powerful built-in features and specialized functionalities to simplify and
accelerate code editing process.
An IDE, on the other hand, is a set of software development tools designed to make coding easier.

Python IDE’s:
------------
Pycharm:
-------
PyCharm and it has been considered the best IDE for python developers.
It was developed by the Czech company JetBrains and it’s a cross-platform IDE.
It gives daily tips to improve your knowledge of how you can use it more efficiently which is a very good feature.
It comes in two versions community version and a professional version where community version is free but the
professional version is paid.

Advantages:
-----------
1.	It is considered as an intelligent code editor, fast and safe refactoring, and smart code.
2.	Features for debugging, profiling, remote development, testing the code, auto code completion, quick fixing,
    error detection and tools of the database.
3.	Support for Popular web technologies, web frameworks, scientific libraries and version control.
4.	Framework that can be used with pycharm is Django, Flask, Maya.
5.	PyCharm is easy to use and install.
6.	Syntax and error maintenance, it can help in the analisation of syntax error even before you compile your code
    reduce any overhead.
7.	Language injections, it allows you to use the output of a function, the value of variables or any object inside
    a template string that can be injected inside an HTML tag for further usage.
8.	Import assistance, this can allow importing missing libraries from another part of the project.
9.	Code completion, allows you to complete name of classes, methods, parameters and other variables depending upon
     the context.
10.	 PyCharm comes with many plug-ins that can be used to enhance your project.

Disadvantages of PyCharm:
-------------------------
-> The main disadvantage of using PyCharm is, it takes more space than other text editors which degrade the
    functionality of code.
-> The community version is idle for python development only and does not allow to use other programming languages.
-> The professional version is somewhat expensive.
-> It can be complicated for beginners to set a virtual environment variable and thus they might not prefer to use it.

Spyder:
-------
Spyder is another good open-source and cross-platform IDE written in Python. It is also called Scientific Python
Development IDE and it is the most lightweight IDE for Python. It is mainly used by data scientists who can
integrate with Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Cython, IPython, SymPy, and other open-source software. It
comes with the Anaconda package manager distribution and it has some good advanced features such as edit, debug,
and data exploration.

Advantages:
-----------
•	Auto code completion and syntax highlighting.
•	Ability to search and edit the variables from the graphical user interface itself.
•	Static code analysis
•	It is very efficient in tracing each step of the script execution by a powerful debugger.
•	It is free of cost.
•	Different layouts are available for the software which will give the users freedom to decide what layout works
    best for them.
•	Very versatile and easy to use.
•	Run Python Codes

Disadvantages:
-------------
•	Not suitable for Collaborative work.
•	Difficult to setup its environment.

Eclipse PyDev
--------------
Eclipse is one of the most popular IDE among developers which is written in Java but you can install Pydev plugin in
eclipse and use it for Python as well.  PyDev is a plugin that enables Eclipse to be used as a Python IDE. The primary
focus of this IDE is the analysis of code, debugging in the graphical pattern, refactoring of python code, etc.
Eclipse PyDev is stable and provides good performance for most of the python project life cycle.

Advantages:
-----------
•	Pydev supports Django integration, Unittest integration, PyLint integration
•	Code folding and code completion with auto import
•	Good syntax high lighting and remote debugger
•	Interactive console
•	Allows you to create a Google App Engine (GAE) Python project

Disadvantages:
--------------
•	Eclipse setup is long, non-intuitive and not user-friendly for beginners.
•	The documentation feature is so difficult that it is often not used.
•	The Project explorer is hard to read and not a good organizer.

Python Code Editor:
-------------------
Visual Studio Code:
--------------------
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and open-source code editor created by Microsoft that can be used for
 Python development.
You can add the extension to create a Python development environment.
It provides support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, IntelliSense code completion, snippets,
and code refactoring.

Advantages:
----------
•	Thousands of plugins/extensions available through the VS Code Marketplace.
•	Powerful debugger by which the user can debug code from the editor itself.
•	Easily customizable.
•	Multi-platform, multi-language support, multi-split window feature and vertical orientation.

Disadvantages:
--------------
•	More advanced debugging features would be helpful.
•	Not easy to install all necessary plugins to make the system stable.
•	Sometimes plugin installation can force VS Code to crash.
•	Needs a lot of allocated RAM memory.

Sublime Text:
-------------
Written by a Google engineer sublime text is a cross-platform IDE developed in C++ and Python.
It has basic built-in support for Python.
Sublime text is fast and you can customize this editor as per your need to create a full-fledged Python development
 environment.
You can install packages such as debugging, auto-completion, code linting, etc.
There are also various packages for scientific development, Django, Flask and so on.

Advantages:
-----------
•	Go to anything for opening files with few clicks and can navigate to words or symbols.
•	Python-based plugin API.
•	Syntax highlighting and allows simultaneous editing (multiple selections)
•	Command Palette implementation that accepts text input from users.
•	High performance, block selection and simultaneous editing (multiple selections).
