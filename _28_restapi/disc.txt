Install Steps
I have followed this medium guide to get the project going, but if you already understand python and Django you can
        skip this.

Migrate Database models
It turns out that Django comes with a few models already built in. We need to migrate those built in models to our
        database.

python manage.py migrate
If you have added models of your own you need migrate those models with

python manage.py makemigrations
Create Super User
python manage.py createsuperuser

  Username (leave blank to use 'alihussain'):
  Email address: alihussain5499@gmail.com
  Password:
  Password (again):
  Superuser created successfully.
Create Some Records
We need to add some records to our hero table. We can do that by starting the server and adding them.

python manage.py runserver
